# Car Comparison App

## Description

**Car Comparison** is an analysis tool developed in Python using Jupyter Notebook. It allows users to compare the cost-benefit of two vehicle models — a combustion car and an electric car — over eight years. The application calculates and compares the costs of acquisition, fuel (or electricity), insurance, maintenance, depreciation, IPVA and unspecified additional costs, which may arise from maintenance, natural or accidental wear and tear of the vehicle, allowing the user to make a more informed decision when choosing between a combustion vehicle and an electric one.

## Features

- **Data Entry**: The user enters the financial and consumption information for each vehicle, including:
- Initial value
- Interest and financing rates (if applicable)
- Fuel consumption (km/l) for combustion vehicles
- Electricity consumption (kWh/km) for electric vehicles
- Price per liter of fuel and kWh
- Other relevant data, such as insurance, IPVA and depreciation
- **Total Cost Calculation**: The application calculates the total annual cost for each vehicle considering the parameters provided and displays a comparative table of the costs accumulated over eight years.
- **Comparison and Decision**: At the end, the application highlights which vehicle has the best cost-benefit ratio over the period.
